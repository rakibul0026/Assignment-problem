/*4) Implement an abstract class player and two subclasses named batsman and bowler.
Each player has a name, contact address, telephone number and status (either
batsman or bowler). The batsman class maintains the total run obtained by a
batsman and the number of one day matches he participated. Similarly, the bowler
class maintains the total wickets taken by a player and the total number of matches.
The parent class contains an abstract method to calculate the average of each
player. Implement the above classes in Java. Provide constructors to initialize the
private data. Override the toString() method in each class to display the class name.
Write a program to create an object of type batsman and bowler and calculate the
average run/ wickets obtained by a player. Your program should also call the
toString() method to display the class name*/
