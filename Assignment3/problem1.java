/*1) Design a class named Student that has two private data â€“ student ID and score. The
class should contain a parameterized constructor to initialize its data member and
one method to display the information. Now write a Java program that will use an
array of Student objects to represent information about 3 students. Your program
should take input from the keyboard and display the information of the 3 students.*/
